Introduction
The Elegoo Smart Car Version 4 is an exciting platform that offers a hands-on learning experience in robotics and programming. In this workshop, we will explore the capabilities of the smart car and learn how to customize its code to perform specific tasks and behaviors.

Getting Started
To get started with the workshop, please follow the instructions below:

Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Make sure you have all the necessary requirements (detailed below).
Install the required libraries and dependencies (explained in the Installation section).
Familiarize yourself with the provided code and documentation.
Attend the workshop sessions or follow the provided workshop materials.
Customize and modify the code to suit your desired functionality.
Contribute to the project by sharing your enhancements and modifications (optional).
Requirements
To participate in this workshop and customize the code for the Elegoo Smart Car Version 4, you will need the following:

An Elegoo Smart Car Version 4 kit.
A compatible microcontroller (Arduino Uno or similar).
A computer with the Arduino IDE installed.
Basic programming knowledge (C++ and Arduino).
Familiarity with electronics and hardware connections.
Enthusiasm to learn and experiment!
Installation
To install the required libraries and dependencies for customizing the Elegoo Smart Car Version 4 code, please follow these steps:

Connect your microcontroller (Arduino Uno or similar) to your computer.
Install the Arduino IDE by downloading it from the official Arduino website.
Launch the Arduino IDE and navigate to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries.
Search for and install the following libraries:
Elegoo Car: This library provides a set of functions and utilities specifically designed for the Elegoo Smart Car.
NewPing: This library enables easy and accurate measurement of distances using ultrasonic sensors.
Any other required libraries (specified in the workshop materials or documentation).
Once the libraries are installed, you're ready to start customizing the code!
Usage
To use the code provided in this workshop or to customize it further, follow these steps:

Open the Arduino IDE.
Connect your microcontroller to your computer.
Open the main Arduino sketch file (usually named "SmartCar.ino") from the downloaded repository.
Review the existing code and comments to understand the functionality.
Make any necessary modifications or enhancements to the code.
Compile the code to ensure there are no errors.
Upload the code to your microcontroller.
Test the customized code on your Elegoo Smart Car Version 4.
Customization
The Elegoo Smart Car Version 4 provides a wide range of customization possibilities. Here are a few areas you can explore:
